  Hi, I’m Tran Ngoc Thao Tien (Tien). I blend hands-on operations experience with practical analytics to solve day-to-day business problems. My background spans export operations, sales coordination, and stakeholder communication across Sales, Planning, and Logistics. I design lightweight data models, automate repetitive reporting, and align metrics so everyone is looking at the same truth.<br>
  <b>Toolbox:</b> Power BI, Power Query, advanced Excel (PivotTables, XLOOKUP, VBA), basic SQL; familiarity with SAP/ERP/CRM.<br><br>
  <br><br>
  I hold a Master’s in International Business (UEH) and am transitioning into a Business Intelligence Analyst path—focusing on transforming operational and commercial data into simple dashboards, measurable outcomes, and better decisions.
